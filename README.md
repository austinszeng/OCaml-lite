# OCaml-lite

"Building an interpreter for a small but complete programming language. Specifically, ...a subset of OCaml dubbed OCaml-lite."

```Reed College's CSCI384 (Programming Language Design and Implementation) course "final project" spanning the last 6 weeks of the semester.```

Questions:
- does the parser always take in a program for parsing? it doesn't seem like a binding can "become" and expr. exprs are contained in bindings, but what if a simple "program" like "5+5;;" is written?
